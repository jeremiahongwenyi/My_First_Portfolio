    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I began my career as a Relationship Officer at Equity Bank,
         where I drove a 20% revenue increase through digital banking adoption. 
</p>
        <p>I later transitioned into tech, 
            completing an internship in software   
            development before joining Equity Group as a Frontend Developer.</p>
        <p>
            My top skills include building responsive user interfaces, 
            integrating RESTful APIs, and applying best practices in 
            state management using frameworks like Angular and React and Vue
        </p>
        <p>
            What sets me apart is my rare combination of business insight and technical expertise. I don't just write code — I build solutions that align with real-world user needs and business goals.
            This allows me to create frontend applications that are not only performant and scalable, but also intuitive and user-focused — making life easier for both users and stakeholders.
            If you're looking for someone who understands both the user and the system, I’d love to connect and help bring your vision to life.
